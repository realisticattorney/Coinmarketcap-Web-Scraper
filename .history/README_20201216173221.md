# Coinmarketcap-Web-Scraper

For this project I created a web scraper that returns a list of prices for different types of assets you can choose from the program's welcome menu. The information is taken from http:/coinmarketcap.com. To parse the HTML from it I've used Nokogiri gem, and to give it format and take specific data from it I've used HTTParty gem.
